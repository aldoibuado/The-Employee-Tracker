## Description

Companies whether big or small need a way to track their employees, knowing their roles and departments. Being able to create an employee tracker helps with doing just that. This program can help with viewing different departments, roles, employees, adding a new employee and even has the ability to delete information as well. I was able to incorporate using sql by having a schema and seeds file with the appropriate information regarding a company.
